# HTML Structure
Now that we know how to spin up a web page, let's get back to the basics and explore how to structure our HTML files better. ðŸ“„

Here are some must-haves in a .html file!

The <!DOCTYPE html> is the document type declaration that appears at the top of a .html file and tells the browser that our file is written in HTML5. This is used with a <html> element containing all the code processed on the page.

We skipped them in the first chapter, but all HTML files must start with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and the <html> element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  Code goes here
</html>

Notice how the <!DOCTYPE html> doesnâ€™t have a closing tag, while <html> does.

Inside <html>, there should be two elements:

<head> contains all the info for your browser that's not visible on the page.
<body> contains all of the content that you will end up seeing on the page.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    Some code goes here
  </head>
  <body>
    A lot more goes here
  </body>
</html>

The <title> element goes in the <head> and assigns text to the browser tab.

The browser tab looks like this when you visit codedex.io:



The code for this would be:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>CodÃ©dex | Start your coding adventure â‹†Ë™âŸ¡</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Code goes here
  </body>
</html>

And all the "main" code goes in the <body> element.

Instructions
Let's practice HTML structure by creating a file called blueprint.html.

Make sure to add the following:

A <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
A <html> element with:
A <head> element with a page title.
A <body> element with a paragraph.
You now have the blueprint that you can use for all future HTML files!
