   code:

  <br><br>
  Favorite Color: <input type="text">
  <input type="submit">
</form>



Explanation of the code:

   A simple dialog in the context of <form method="dialog"> is an interactive form that works inside a native HTML <dialog> element. When paired with method="dialog", it allows a quick and lightweight way to capture or confirm user input in a modal-like popup.

Here's what happens with your example:

Key Features of the Simple Dialog:
Works Inside a <dialog>:
The form must be enclosed in a <dialog> element to function as a dialog box.

Purpose of method="dialog":
It simplifies capturing user interaction with the form.
The formâ€™s submit button closes the dialog and returns the form's input values.

Automatically Closes on Submission:
Once the user fills the form and clicks "Submit," the dialog box closes by itself.

Easy Value Retrieval:
The returned values (via dialog.returnValue) can be accessed in JavaScript for further use.

  # Input Validation
By now, we've explored different types of inputs for HTML forms.

But how do we make sure that the right data is going into the form? For example, if a form asks for an email, how can it tell that the input is a valid email that includes the @ symbol?

HTML forms actually have a few tools for this!

For example, the "email" type checks if the submitted input is a valid email address:



Forms can also mask text input if the <input> element has a "password" type. We can even give it a minlength and maxlength attribute to further validate the input:

<input type="password" minlength="4" maxlength="10">

If we render this:



We also can't type past 10 characters (via maxlength) and a message appears if we submit less than 4 characters.

# Required Data
Oftentimes, forms need input in order to be submitted.

The required attribute can be applied to one or more form inputs to enforce this.

<form method="dialog">
  Name: <input type="text" required>
  <br><br>
  Favorite Color: <input type="text">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

The<input> element for a "Name" is marked with the required attribute.

Here is what happens when submitting without filling out this input:



Instructions
Let's add some form validation to the sign_up.html file we created in the last exercise.

Make the <input> elements for the username, email, and password required.
Give the username and password inputs a minlength of "4" and a maxlength of "10".
After finishing, try to submit the form with incomplete or incorrect inputs.
