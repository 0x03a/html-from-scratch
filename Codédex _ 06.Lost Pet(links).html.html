# Links
The first website ever from 1991 is still up: TheProject.html

What do you notice? Besides the fact that it is bare-boned, there are a bunch of links! 🔗

Links are integral to the idea of the internet. They are how users connect to other sites and navigate the web.

So how do we add a link to our web page?

We can use the <a> anchor element! This link tag allows us to add a hyperlink to a piece of text.

Let's see how we can do this:

<a href="https://archive.org/web">Internet Archive</a>

Here, the <a> anchor element is similar to other tags, where the text inside is what is displayed. But what about the href inside the opening tag?

An href, or hyperlink reference, is a reference or pointer to another website that is linked in our HTML. When the text “Internet Archive” is clicked, the HTML will redirect to that site, which in our case, is https://archive.org/web.

Note: This can also be used to point to an email or phone number using a mailto:, tel:, or sms: parameter:

<a href="mailto:frankie@gmail.com">📧</a>
<a href="tel:212-555-2368">🤙</a>
<a href="sms:320-250-HTML">💬</a>
# Images
What if we want to add images? We can use a similar format, but with the <img> image element.

<p>Here's a cute pic:</p>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg">

The <img> image element is another self-closing tag, so it doesn't have a closing tag.

srcattribute, which stands for “source”, specifies the file path of the image.
"https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg"is the image path.
For most images, the file path can be found by right-clicking on the image and selecting "Copy Image Address".

Instructions
