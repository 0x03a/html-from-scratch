  # Congrats!
Nice! Congrats on reaching the end of another chapter! ðŸŽŠ

Here is a quick summary of what we learned:

The <form> and <input> elements are for accepting (and eventually processing) user input.
The <input> element comes with many types, including number, checkbox, and radio.
We can also enter information for dates or color in the <input> element.
The <textarea> is for longer text input and the <label> element helps organize a form.
Forms have ways of validating user input, including requiring certain information to be submitted.
Here is a basic <form> with all of the fun tools we learned about:

<form>
  <label></label>
  <input type ="text" minlength="" maxlength="">
  <input type ="number" min="" max="">
  <input type ="checkbox">
  <input type ="radio">

  <textarea></textarea>
  
  <input type="email" required>
  <input type="password" required>
  <input type="submit" required>
</form>

Instructions
For the last exercise, let's build a form page for a new website called "Welp!"

It's a review site like Yelp, which is well-known for its reviews of restaurants by foodies. Instead of food reviews, Welp can be about reviewing anything from books to film to public parks!

Create a new file called welp.html.

After setting up the file, add a <form> element in the <body>.

Let's include this information (in order):

The reviewer's name (first, last, nickname, doesn't matter).*
The name of what they're reviewing (film name, book title, etc.).*
Three "radio" buttons that ask if the reviewer would try again.
An <input> to offer a rating (1 out of 5).*
A <textarea> element for the reviewer to write comments (no more than 250 characters).
An input type of "submit" that says "Submit Review".
The inputs with * are required.

Make sure to add labels and validate the inputs!

After you're finished, share a screenshot of your review form on Twitter!

        <br><br>
        Give rating from 1 out of 5:
        <br>
        <input type="number" min="1" max="5"  placeholder="give ratings" required style="width: 85px;">
        <br><br>
