# Headings
Let's look at some more elements.

Suppose we want to add a headline to our website that displays a news article. Here's how we would do it using a <h1> heading element and a <p> paragraph element:

<body>
  <h1>Breaking News ðŸš¨</h1>
  <p>Florida man once evaded arrest by cartwheeling now running for mayor.</p>
</body>

There are six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>:

<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>

Here's the result:

HTML headings sizes comparison

Note: Only one <h1> element should be used in a .html file.

# Line Break
Suppose we also want to add a new line within a paragraph element. Pressing enter won't do us any good because HTML ignores multiple spaces and line breaks within elements.

So we must use the <br> break tag here!

The <br> break tag adds a line break:

<body>
  <h1>Breaking News</h1>
  <p>Florida man robs convenience store with an alligator.<br>Leaves a baby Crocs behind.</p>
</body>

A self-closing tag doesn't need to be closed manually by a closing tag... it does not have a separate closing </tag>. The break tag is the first one we have encountered.

The final code will become:

Florida man
