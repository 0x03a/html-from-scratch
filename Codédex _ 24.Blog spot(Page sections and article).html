# Page Sections
Within the main section of a page are smaller, separate parts. The element we use for this isâ€¦ you guessed it! The <section> element!

We use the <section> element to group pieces of related content together.

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Section A</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Section B</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Section C</h2>
  </section>
</main>

Note: Unlike the <main> element, a page can have multiple <section> elements!

In many cases, it makes sense for a heading element (<h1>-<h6>) to be the first child of a <section> element.

We want to explicitly display what each section in the page is about.

# Single Articles
Semantic content goes one layer further!

While the <section> element groups together pieces of related content, we use the <article> element for those singular pieces of content.

The <article> element is used like so:

<section>
  <h2>Section Heading</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Article Heading</h3>
    Piece of content
  </article>
</section>

The rendered code should look like this:


While not required, an <article> element should begin with a heading element (much like with a <section> element).

You can also nest an <article> within another <article> element. This is usually done if there is a piece of standalone markup within a single piece of content (e.g., a single comment from a single blog post).

Instructions
Now, we're going to add some structure inside of the <main> element of our blog page.

In the my_blog.html file, let's do the following:

Insert two <section> elements, each with an <h2> heading element for "About" and "Stories".
Place an <article> element in the "About" section and write a 2-3 sentence bio of you, the blogger.
Place 2-3 <article> elements in the "Stories" section. Each one represents a single blog post.
Feel free to be creative with the content of each post, but make sure to include an <h3> heading title and a <p> paragraph element of 2-3 sentences.
