  # What are Forms?
What do sign up, login, and checkout pages have in common? They all collect user input data! 📋

In this chapter, we're going to learn how to take input from the user with forms!

Forms come in every shape and form (pun intended). From buying something online to using a search engine, forms are a part of everyday digital life.

They're pretty straight-forward:

The user enters some information.
The user presses a “Submit” button.
And something happens!
For example, searching on Wikipedia is just filling out and submitting a form:



To create a form in HTML, we can use the <form> element:

<form action="" method="">
  <!-- More code will go here
</form>

Two attributes are commonly used with the <form> element:

The action attribute that says where the form data should go after it is submitted.
The method attribute for how the form data is processed.
It is usually either sent somewhere else via "post" or used with something else via "get".

Note: For the rest of this chapter, the action and method attributes will not be featured in the examples. Not to worry, though! The forms will still render just fine. 😀

# Inputs
But wait… how do we even enter the form data? How do we submit it?

In HTML forms, we use the <input> element as an interactive control for entering data. A type attribute is used to determine the kind of input to use. While there are many types of inputs, the two we'll use most often are:

A text value that renders a plain textbox on the form.
<form>
  <input type="text">
</form>

A submit value that turns the <input> element into a button for submitting the form data.
<form>
  <input type="submit">
</form>

Note: The <input> element uses a self-closing tag.

This is what both look like in a <form> element:



By default, the text of the "submit" input type will say "Submit", but this can be changed by setting a value attribute for the <input> element:

<input type="submit" value="Submit Form!">

This is what the altered "submit" input now looks like:

Instructions
For this exercise, we are going to recreate one of the most notable forms on the Internet: the original Google search bar!

Create a new file called google.html.

Copy and paste the following code into an editor:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Google</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Form code goes here 
  </body>
</html>

Next, let's replace the comment with a <form> element. For now, we can either set the action and method attributes to nothing, "", or just not add them.

Then, add these elements:

A <p> paragraph element that reads "Search the web using Google!".
An <input> element with the type set to "text", followed by a <br> line break element.
Another <input> element, but with this one's type is set to "submit" (its text should say "Google Search").
Note: If we submit this form, nothing will really happen because we haven't told the form where to send the data.

  <input type="text"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Google Search">
