# HTML5
Great job on reaching the final chapter of the HTML course!

We are going to revisit HTML structure, but from a different angle. Much like the underpinning of a house, semantic HTML elements improve the foundation of any web page!

HTML5 is the version of HTML we use today. Prior to its release in 2008, it was less easy to tell the purpose or meaning of the different elements of a web page.

When programming in HTML, the markup should make sense to both the programmer and the browser itself.

# Semantic Elements
Thus far, we've used elements like <div> and <span> to structure content. But neither of these elements convey meaning to either the programmer or the browser.

One of the goals of HTML5 is to upgrade the structure with new semantic elements that provide the following benefits:

They can be engaged with and accessed by a wider range of users, such as ones who use screen readers.
The content within these elements are more discoverable for users through places like search engines.
The actual HTML code becomes cleaner and easier for programmers to read and maintain.
Instructions
For this chapter, we will build our very own blog website, step by step, using semantic elements!

But first, like we did in a bonus article, let's use the browser's developer tools to inspect MDN's article about semantics to observe semantic elements in action!

Which ones can you find?

Google Chrome: Right-click and go to "Inspect". Click the pointer-icon icon in the top-left corner of the dev tools and hover over an element in the page to inspect it.
Safari: Click "Safari", then "Preferences". Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Show Develop menu in menu bar". Now click "Develop" and then "Show Web Inspector".
