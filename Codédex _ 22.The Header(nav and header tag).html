  # The Header
When you visit most sites nowadays, you may notice they have a space near the top for information like the following:

The website logo.
The title of the site.
A search bar.
Some links to other parts of the site.
A button to sign in.
Even CodÃ©dex uses a header for its site!

CodÃ©dex Header

This space is known as the header of the site. The element we use for that is the <header> element:

<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
  </header>
</body>

The <header> element always goes in the <body> element. It usually contains a heading element (<h1>-<h6>).

Note: This is not to be confused with the <head> element that exists outside the <body> element.

# Navigation
Again, the header of a page usually features links for navigating to other places within the site.

The semantic element used for this is the <nav> element. This usually goes inside of a <header> element.

Here is an example:

<header>
  <nav>
    <!-- Links go here --
  </nav>
</header>

The <nav> element may contain ordered lists, unordered lists, or a combination of both.

Instructions
In this chapter, we're going to gradually build a simple blog page in each exercise, using semantic elements.

Let's start by creating the header and navigation from the top of the page!

Create a new file called my_blog.html.

Next, copy/paste the following markup:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title><!-- Title of blog here --  </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Header and nav list go here --
  </body>
</html>

Then, replace the comments with the following information:

The title of your blog (in the <title> element).
An <h1> heading element for your blog, featuring its title.
An unordered list of 2 links; one for "About" and one for "Stories".
Note: Don't forget to save your file before moving forward!

        <h1>Codedex</h1> <!-- Blog's title in an <h1> heading -->
        <nav>
            <ul> <!-- Unordered list containing the links -->
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahello" target="_blank">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site+map" target="_blank">Stories</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
</body>
</html>
