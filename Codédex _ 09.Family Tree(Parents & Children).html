# Parents & Children
The elements in our HTML file are arranged much like a family tree. Most individual elements can be parents with one or more child elements.

For example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Well, <i>howdy</i> <u>there!</u></p> 
  </body>
</html>


Here are some relationships:

<head> and <body> are children of <html>.
<title> is the child of <head>.
<i> is child of <p> and grandchild of <body>.
<i> and <u> are siblings because they belongs to same
parent.


# Siblings
Elements can also be siblings if they share a direct parent element. Take this unordered list, for instance:

<body>
  <ul>
    <li>🍄 Mario</li>
    <li>🐢 Luigi</li>
  </ul>
</body>

The two <li> elements are siblings because both are children of the same parent, the <ul> element.

Instructions
"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

Create a family_tree.html file for your family using list elements such as <ul> and <li> elements. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

If you are stuck, try doing one for the British Royal Family, the Kardashians, the Starks, or the Simpsons.

Once you are done, ask yourself:

Which elements are parents?
Which elements are children?
Which elements are siblings?
Note: Set up your web page properly with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, etc.

         <li> li in <b>ol</b> is a child of <b>ol</b> and grandchild of <b>ul</b> and grand grand child of <b>body</b>.</li>
         <li> Now in <b>ul</b> the two <b>li</b> and <b>ol</b> are siblings.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
