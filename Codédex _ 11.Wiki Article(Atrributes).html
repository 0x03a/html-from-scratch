# Attributes
Attributes are additional settings that we can use to customize an element.

They are usually name/value pairs, like name="value", where the name and value are separated by an equals sign:

<element name="value">Content</element>

The name indicates the attribute we are setting for our element.
The "value" for our attribute is surrounded by " double quotes.
For example, by default, the <ol> ordered list element uses numbers to label its <li> list item elements.

<ol>
  <li>Power ⚡</li>
  <li>Courage 🔥</li>
  <li>Wisdom 🦉</li>
</ol>



If we want to use lowercase letters instead:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Power ⚡</li>
  <li>Courage 🔥</li>
  <li>Wisdom 🦉</li>
</ol>



Or, if want to use Roman numerals:

<ol type="i">
  <li>Power ⚡</li>
  <li>Courage 🔥</li>
  <li>Wisdom 🦉</li>
</ol>



## Attributes in Image Tag
Guess what? We've already been using a few different attributes in the course. Remember when we learned about images?

<img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/tier1.png">

The <img> element uses the src attribute to specify the file path of an image.

And remember that width="250" attribute from the previous exercise? Yup! That was an attribute that sets the width of the image.

In addition to src, we can also use the alt attribute to make our images more accessible.

<img alt="pixel girl using a laptop" src="https://www.codedex.io/images/tier1.png">

If our image can't appear for some reason, the alt text is displayed instead! This allows assistive devices to read our text and describe the image. 🦻🏻

## Attribute in Anchor Tag
We also came across attributes when learning about using links with <a> anchor tags:

<a href="https://www.codedex.io/">Codédex</a>

The href attribute is where we add a URL that can be visited when the hyperlinked text is clicked.

We can also use the target attribute and set it to "_blank" to make the link open in a new browser tab:

<a href="https://www.codedex.io/" target="_blank">Codédex</a>

Instructions
You’ve been asked to write a Wikipedia article about one of your heroes (dead or alive).

Create a wiki_article.html file that mimics their wiki profile.

Make sure to include the following:

One heading that says "Biography".
An image of that person that includes alternative text.
One paragraph with at least 2 sentences.
One link in the text (opens on a new tab).
Bonus: How can we adjust the size of the image using attributes? How can we make the image a hyperlink?
