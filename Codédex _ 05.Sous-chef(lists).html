# Lists
Lists are a great way to manage time, figure out what needs to be done, and remember things. And it feels good when we check items off!

We will learn about two types of HTML lists:

<ul> Unordered lists
<ol> Ordered lists
For unordered lists, also known as bullet points, start with the <ul> tag and wrap each item in a <li> list item element. Like so:

<ul>
  <li>ğŸ§º Go to laundromat.</li>
  <li>ğŸ–¥ Code for 45 min.</li>
  <li>ğŸ’… Take a bubble bath.</li>
</ul>

unordered list example

The <ul> is great for listing things in any order. But what if we wanted to number the list?

For ordered lists, also known as numbered lists, we use the <ol> element:

<ol>
  <li>ğŸ§º Go to laundromat.</li>
  <li>ğŸ–¥ Code for 45 min.</li>
  <li>ğŸ’… Take a bubble bath.</li>
</ol>

Create a chef.html file with the recipe of a dish you've been craving!

First, google a recipe.

Then, let's make two lists with HTML:

An unordered list of the ingredients.
An ordered list of cooking instructions.
