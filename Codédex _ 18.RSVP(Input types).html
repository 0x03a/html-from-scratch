  # Input Type: Number
There may be times when numbers may be involved in forms. This could be anything from a person's age to the number of items bought at a store.

To prompt the <input> element for numbers, we do the following:

<input type="number">

Try it out! Type a number in the bow below:


When the cursor hovers above this input, "up" and "down" arrow buttons appear on the right side.

By default, selecting these buttons moves the numeric value up or down by 1. However, a step attribute can be used to change this:

<input type="number" step="2">

This renders the following:


So instead of the input value going up or down by 1, it goes up or down by 2.

Additionally, a max and min attribute can be used to set how high or low this input can go:

<input type="number" min="1" max="42">

This is the rendered output:


# Input Type: Checkbox and Radio
There are also input types that allow us to make one or more choices from a list of options. Two of them are "checkbox" and "radio".

The "checkbox" type renders as a box that is ticked off to mark the input as "finished" or "complete."

<h3>Favorite Movie Genres</h3>
<input type="checkbox"> Action<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Sci-Fi<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Rom-Com<br>
<input type="checkbox"> K-Drama<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Documentary<br>

The code above renders this:



We can check off multiple items with this input type.

Next, there's the "radio" button type. Like with checkboxes, radio buttons are lists of options. However, only one option can be selected.

Here's an example that highlights a recent popular illusion:

<h3>Which do you think?</h3>
<input type="radio"> Yanny
<br>
<input type="radio"> Laurel

This is what the rendered inputs look like:



Wait a second... it can't be both "Yanny" and "Laurel", right? Shouldn't only one option be selected at a time?

The way to make this so is by assigning a matching name attribute to each "radio" input type. This puts them in the same group of options to choose from.

<h3>Which do you think?</h3>
<input type="radio" name="option"> Yanny
<br>
<input type="radio" name="option"> Laurel

The output should now work as expected:



Instructions
Let's use these new inputs to write an RSVP for a special occasion! ðŸŽˆ

Create a new file called rsvp.html.

Copy/paste the following code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>RSVP</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <!-- Form code here --
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

Next, replace the comment in the <body> with the following <form> element.

Then, paste the following in between the <form> tags:

<form>
  <h2>RSVP</h2>
  <p>Come and make our special day more awesome!</p>
  <br>
  First Name: <!-- Text input here --
  <br><br>
  Last Name: <!-- Text input here --
  <br><br>
  Are you coming?<br>
  <!-- 3 radio inputs here --
  <br><br>
  Any dietary restrictions for main course?<br>
  <!-- 3 or 5 checkbox inputs here --
  <br><br>
  <!-- Submit input here 
 </form>

Replace the comments with the following <input> elements, using the appropriate type attributes:

Two text inputs for the first and last name.
Three radio buttons labeled as "Yes", "No", and "Maybe" (with a matching name of "invite").
Either three or five checkbox options to specify dietary restrictions like "Vegetarian" and "Gluten-free".
An input to submit the form.
