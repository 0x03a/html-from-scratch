# Comments
Comments are useful for taking notes about the logic and intentions behind different parts of our web page. They help us understand what our code is doing, especially if it was written a while ago.

Not only should comments benefit whoever wrote the code, but they should also be helpful to anyone reviewing it later.

How do we comment in HTML? It’s simple:

<!-- I am a comment. -->
<!--
<p>And I'm not a comment!</p>

Everything surrounded by the <!-- and --> comment markers is ignored and not rendered on the browser:

<!-- Let’s make you a comment, too. -->
<!-- <p>Nooo!</p> -->

<!--
# Inline vs. Multi-line
Comments are super flexible because they can span multiple lines:

<!--
  This is also a comment.
-->
<!--
They can also be used within an element:

<p>This text is visible. <!-- But this is not. --></p>
<!--
Note: It isn't recommended that you be excessive with comments. They should be used sparingly and removed when no longer needed.

Instructions
Craigslist is a website that looks straight out of the 90s. That's because it has stayed roughly the same!

It was started by Craig Newark in 1995 as an email list for his San Francisco friends. Today, the company does over $1 billion a year in revenue, operating from a tiny office. 🤯
