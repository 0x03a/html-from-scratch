  # The style Attribute
So far, the appearance of our pages has been pretty skeletal. Just some plain text with the occasional list, image, or link.

But what if there were ways to improve this within our .html files? As it turns out, there are!

First, we can apply a style attribute to any HTML element to stylize certain aspects of that element, such as what color the text should be:

<p>
  Roses are <span style="color:red;">red</span>.<br />
  Violets are <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.
</p>

This attribute uses a special syntax where a style is made of a property (i.e., color) and a value (red), separated by a : colon. Multiple styles can be applied to a single element, but they must be separated by a ; semi-colon.

<p>
  Roses are <span style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">red</span>.<br />
  Violets are <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">blue</span>.
</p>

The following is the rendered paragraph with our styles applied to the <span> elements:



The color property sets the color for the text of an element.
The text-decoration adds text formatting (such as underline), similar to what the <b>, <i>, <u>, and <s> elements do.
This is actually a language called CSS, which we will learn in the next course.

# The <style> Element
Using the style attribute for a few elements is one thing. But what if we want to add styles to a bunch of different elements? Or what if we want to add the same styles to each instance of a specific element?

Alternatively, the <style> element can be used in the <head> to style our elements in the <body>.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      ... Styles for elements go here
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    ... Elements go here
  </body>
</html>

Elements can be selected inside the <style> element using { } curly braces:

<style>
  element {
    property: value;
  }
</style>

Remember when we learned about the class and id attributes? Inside the <style> element, you can use a period . (class) or hashtag # (id) to select one or more specific elements that have a matching class or id, respectively:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      span {
        text-decoration: underline;
      }

      #red-word {
        color: red;
      }

      #blue-word {
        color: blue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Roses are <span id="red-word">red</span>.<br />
      Violets are <span id="blue-word">blue</span>.<br />
    </p>
  </body>
</html>

Instructions
In 1993, the "Mighty Morphin‚Äô Power Rangers" premiered on TV, fighting forces of evil. The five original rangers were each represented by a different color:

‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Red
üíô Blue
üñ§ Black
üíõ Yellow
üíñ Pink
Create a new file called power-rangers.html.

Copy/paste this code in the <body> element:

<div class="ranger-div" id="red-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="blue-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="black-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="yellow-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="pink-ranger"></div>

Insert a <style> element in the <head>. Then, apply the following styles in the <style> element:

A width of 50% and height of 100px for <div> divider elements with the ranger-div class.
A different background-color for each <div> divider element based on their id.
